# Reproducible research: version control and R

## QUESTION 4
(30 points) Sometimes we are interested in modelling a process that involves randomness. A good example is Brownian motion. We will explore how to simulate a random process in a way that it is reproducible:

a) A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the question-4-code folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points)

a) Executing the code produces a side by side grid of two random walk plots (produced from data1 and data2 respectively). The plots both show unique paths, despite both resulting from running the same function (random_walk) over the same number of steps. (The reason for this becomes clear later on). Time is illustrated using a gradient colour scheme, from darker blue to lighter blue, and this allows us to visualise how the random walks change over time (with earlier steps in darker blue and later steps in lighter blue). Each step on the random walk is set to 0.25 units, and the walk is iterated over 500 steps with a random angle between 0 and 2pi chosen for each step. Combining the angle and step length information leads to x and y coordinates being computed after each step. We can clearly see that both paths begin from the origin, but as the random nature of the walk takes over, they begin to follow very different patterns. On both plots, there are areas where the path seems to be returning over itself, before going on a longer path without seemingly going back on itself. Furthermore, when the code is rerun, both of the plots will change again. This means that the simulation is not reproducible, despite running the same function over the same number of steps.

b) Put simply, a random seed is the initial value that is given to initialise a random number generator. Using a random seed is important in order to ensure reproducibility, as it allows for control over the sequence of numbers generated by a random number generator. Random number generators therefore are really only generating a sequence of pseudo-random numbers, based on a fixed random seed starting point. Every number in the sequence can be traced back to its immediate 'ancestor' in the sequence, and eventually all the way back to the seed. In an experiment like this, it is useful to have a random seed as it allows us to run the same 'random' process over and over again, whilst still allowing for consistency and comparison (as we know that if a seed is reused, the same sequence will follow). This is what we need to include in our model. In order to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion, we should therefore set a random seed.

c) In order to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion, I adjusted the code to include a random seed that could easily be changed. What allowed me to verify that the simulation was now reproducible was the fact that plot1 and plot2 were now identical, when running the same function over the same number of steps (data1 and data2 were now equivalent, and therefore when plotted, the plots are also equivalent).























The two plots show different paths being taken. Due to the pseudo-random generated numbers in the runif() functions which is executed independently in both plots, leading to different outcomes.
No seed is set, so 




b) Investigate the term random seeds. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points)

Random number generation in R is based on a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) - meaning the numbers generated are not truly random. Instead, they follow a predictable pattern determined by a seed. Therefore, using a seed allows one to reproduce the same sequence of random numbers which can be useful for replicating results.



c) Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked reproducible-research_homework repo. (10 points)

Used the set.seed() function to generate reproducible pseudorandom numbers which is reproducible.


d) Go to your commit history and click on the latest commit. Show the edit you made to the code in the comparison view (add this image to the README.md of the fork). (5 points)

## QUESTION 5
(**30 points**) In 2014, Cui, Schlub and Holmes published an article in the *Journal of Virology* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00362-14) showing that the size of viral particles, more specifically their volume, could be predicted from their genome size (length). They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \alpha L^{\beta}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.

   a) Import the data for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses taken from the Supplementary Materials of the original paper into Posit Cloud (the csv file is in the `question-5-data` folder). How many rows and columns does the table have? (3 points)\

Using nrow() and ncol() functions, the table has 33 rows and 13 columns.

   
   b) What transformation can you use to fit a linear model to the data? Apply the transformation. (3 points) \

You can apply a log transformation so that Y = ax^B = ln(Y) = ln(A) + Bln(X)
In this case, ln(V) = ln(a) + Bln(L)


virion_data$log_volume <- log(virion_data$Virion.volume..nm.nm.nm.)




   
   c) Find the exponent ($\beta$) and scaling factor ($\alpha$) of the allometric law for dsDNA viruses and write the p-values from the model you obtained, are they statistically significant? Compare the values you found to those shown in **Table 2** of the paper, did you find the same values? (10 points) \


<img width="460" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d0ef350-d107-4cde-b832-9976ae1d9d02">

P-values shown above, both highly statistically significant.

($\beta$) is equal to 1.52
($\alpha$) is equal to e^7 = 1182

Therefore, exponent and scaling factor the same as that found in the paper.


   
   d) Write the code to reproduce the figure shown below. (10 points)

  </p>


ggplot(data = virion_data, aes(x=log_bases, y=log_volume)) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlab("log [Genome length (kb)]") + 
  ylab("log [Virion volume (nm3)]") +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1))



  

  e) What is the estimated volume of a 300 kb dsDNA virus? (4 points) 





V = aL^B
From work above, a = 1182, B = 1.52
Therefore, when L = 300:
   V = (1182) x (300)^1.52
   = 6880000nm3
